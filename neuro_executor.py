Subject: {position} Application - Neuro Programming Language Creator

Dear {company} Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the {position} position. My work on Neuro, an intent-driven programming language for AI development, directly addresses your focus on building tools that transform how researchers engage with scientific papers.

While you're creating innovative research tools, I've been building Neuro to revolutionize how developers create AI systems. Neuro's natural language understanding and automated workflow generation demonstrate the kind of AI engineering expertise needed for your {position} role.

My background in system validation and reliability engineering ensures I understand how to build production-ready tools that researchers can depend on. Through Neuro's development, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- Natural language processing and understanding systems
- AI workflow automation and optimization
- Scalable system architecture and deployment
- Developer tooling and user experience

The attached resume provides more detail about my experience, and I've included a description of the Neuro project to demonstrate my practical AI engineering capabilities.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with intent-driven AI systems could contribute to {company}'s innovative work in research tooling.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Creator of Neuro Programming Language
