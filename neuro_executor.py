Subject: {position} Application - AI Engineering Background

Dear {company} Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the {position} position. My experience with AI system development and recent work on Neuro, an intent-driven programming language exploration, aligns with your focus on building tools that transform how researchers engage with scientific papers.

While you're creating innovative research tools, I've been exploring new paradigms in AI development through projects like Neuro, which investigates natural language understanding and automated workflow generation. This work demonstrates the kind of AI engineering thinking relevant to your {position} role.

My background in system validation and reliability engineering ensures I understand how to build production-ready tools that researchers can depend on. Through my technical explorations, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- Natural language processing and understanding systems
- AI workflow automation and optimization
- Scalable system architecture and deployment
- Developer tooling and user experience

The attached resume provides more detail about my experience, and I've included a description of my Neuro project exploration to demonstrate my practical AI engineering approach.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with AI systems could contribute to {company}'s innovative work in research tooling.

Best regards,
Elena Mereanu
