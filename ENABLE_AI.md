# Enable AI Features in Neuro

## ðŸ§  Turn On AI-Powered Parsing

Neuro can use **DeepSeek**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, or other LLMs to understand natural language goals.

**ðŸŒŸ Recommended: DeepSeek** (200x cheaper than OpenAI!) â†’ [DeepSeek Setup](DEEPSEEK_SETUP.md)

Here's how to enable it:

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### **Option 1: DeepSeek (Recommended - Cheapest!)**

```bash
# 1. Install package
pip install openai

# 2. Get API key from https://platform.deepseek.com

# 3. Set environment variable
# Windows:
set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Mac/Linux:
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# 4. Run Neuro
python neuro my_task.neuro
```

**Cost:** ~$0.0001 per run (200x cheaper than GPT-4!)

**â†’ [Complete DeepSeek Guide](DEEPSEEK_SETUP.md)**

---

### **Option 2: OpenAI (Alternative)**

```bash
# 1. Install package
pip install openai

# 2. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com

# 3. Set environment variable
# Windows:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Mac/Linux:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# 4. Run Neuro
python neuro my_task.neuro
```

**Cost:** ~$0.02 per run

---

### **Option 3: No AI (Free)**

Works without any API key! Uses pattern matching.

```bash
python neuro my_task.neuro
```

**Cost:** $0.00

---

**Now AI is enabled!** ðŸŽ‰

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What AI Enables

### **Before (Without AI):**

```neuro
// Must use exact syntax
pipeline FindJobs {
    goal: "Find jobs"
    target_roles: ["ai engineer"]
    locations: ["remote"]
}
```

### **After (With AI):**

```neuro
// Natural language works!
goal: "yo find me some sweet remote ai gigs in boston"
```

**AI Understands:**
- "yo" = greeting (ignore)
- "find me" = search action
- "sweet" = high-quality (filter for good matches)
- "remote ai gigs" = remote AI engineer positions
- "boston" = location filter

---

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

### **Step 1: You Write Natural Language**
```neuro
goal: "I want to transition from QA to AI engineering"
```

### **Step 2: AI Parses Intent**
```python
# Neuro sends to GPT-4
"Parse this goal: 'I want to transition from QA to AI engineering'"

# GPT-4 returns
{
    "intent_type": "job_search",
    "target_role": "ai engineer",
    "experience_level": "entry-level",
    "inferred_needs": [
        "resume_optimization",
        "skill_gap_analysis",
        "transitioning_advice"
    ]
}
```

### **Step 3: Neuro Executes**
```python
# Searches for entry-level AI jobs
# Generates QAâ†’AI transition resume
# Provides learning resources
# Creates action plan
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ AI Features Available

### **1. Natural Language Goals**

**Without AI:**
```neuro
goal: "Search job boards for AI engineer positions in remote locations"
```

**With AI:**
```neuro
goal: "find me a dope ai job"
// AI understands informal language!
```

### **2. Intent Inference**

**You Say:**
```neuro
goal: "I'm a QA engineer wanting to switch to AI"
```

**AI Infers:**
- Need: job search
- Level: entry/junior AI roles
- Additional: resume help, skill assessment

### **3. Smart Clarification**

**Ambiguous:**
```neuro
goal: "Train a model"
```

**AI Asks:**
```
I need clarification:
1. What type of model? (classification/regression/LLM)
2. What's your data source?
3. What's your target metric?
```

### **4. Code Generation**

**You Write:**
```neuro
pipeline SentimentAnalysis {
    goal: "Analyze customer sentiment"
    data: "reviews.csv"
}
```

**AI Generates:**
```python
# Automatically generates:
# - Data loading code
# - Sentiment analysis using transformers
# - Result visualization
# - Export to CSV
# ~100 lines of production code
```

## ðŸŽ“ Example: Job Search with AI

### **Natural Language Input**

```neuro
"yo i built this dope ai language called neuro and i want a remote ai job at a startup, 
preferably doing prompt engineering or working with llms, im in boston but open to anywhere"
```

### **What AI Extracts**

```json
{
  "intent_type": "job_search",
  "target_roles": ["prompt engineer", "ai engineer", "llm engineer"],
  "locations": ["remote", "boston"],
  "company_type": "startup",
  "skills": ["neuro", "ai", "llm", "prompt engineering"],
  "experience_level": "mid",
  "remote_preference": true,
  "highlights": ["built ai language (Neuro)"]
}
```

### **What Neuro Does**

```python
# Searches job boards with extracted criteria
# Prioritizes:
# - Startups
# - LLM/Prompt Engineering roles
# - Remote positions
# - Highlights your Neuro project in applications
```

```

**With AI Enabled:**
```neuro
// Pure natural language
"find me a job"
```

**With Full AI (Future):**
