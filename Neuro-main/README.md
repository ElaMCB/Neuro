> "What if you could describe what you want, not how to build it?"

Neuro is a new programming language where you declare what you want to achieve with AI, and the compiler figures out how to make it happen. Stop writing boilerplate code and start declaring your intent.

# Vision
Simple: No AI/ML expertise required

Fast: Minutes instead of weeks

Accessible: Works with just a text editor

Powerful: Builds production-ready systems

Stop writing code. Start declaring intent.

# How It Works

Natural language â†’ AI understanding â†’ Direct execution

# Get Started
Create a .neuro file

Describe your AI task in plain English + simple structure

Neuro handles implementation

## ðŸ§  Job Search System (NEW!)

Neuro now includes an advanced job search system - **declare your job search intent, Neuro finds the jobs!**

### Example: Job Search in Neuro

```neuro
pipeline FindAIPositions {
    goal: "Find prompt engineer and AI engineer jobs with remote-first companies"
    
    target_roles: ["prompt engineer", "ai engineer", "ml engineer"]
    locations: ["remote", "US", "Boston", "New York"]
    company_policy: "remote first"
    skills: ["python", "pytorch", "llm", "gpt", "transformers"]
    experience: "junior level"
    
    actions: [
        search_job_boards(),
        filter_remote_first(),
        match_skills(),
        generate_applications()
    ]
}
```

Run it:
```bash
python run_neuro.py my_job_search.neuro
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Multi-platform search (Wellfound, RemoteOK, Indeed, LinkedIn, startup boards)
- âœ… Automatic profile matching with scoring (0-100%)
- âœ… Resume tailoring for specific jobs
- âœ… Weekly automation
- âœ… Intent-driven - no Python code needed!

See [JOB_SEARCH_README.md](JOB_SEARCH_README.md) for full documentation.

Example Flow:
You type:

text
"I want to transition from QA to AI engineering. I built Neuro and have Python skills. Find me relevant jobs and help optimize my resume."
Neuro understands and:

Analyzes your background

Searches job boards automatically

Generates resume suggestions

Creates interview preparation plan

Tracks applications

All in one step, no code required.

## It's Zero-Friction AI:
## Neuro vs Traditional Programming

| Traditional Approach | Neuro Approach |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Learn programming | Just speak English |
| Write code | Describe goals |
| Debug errors | Get clarification |
| Manage dependencies | Everything just works |
| Compile and run | Instant results |

## The Neuro Revolution

| Aspect | Traditional Development | Neuro Development |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Learning Curve** | Months of programming languages | Minutes of natural language |
| **Development** | Writing detailed implementation code | Describing goals and constraints |
| **Debugging** | Finding and fixing code errors | Getting clarification on intent |
| **Setup** | Complex environments and dependencies | Zero configuration required |
| **Execution** | Compile, build, deploy cycles | Instant understanding and execution |
| **Optimization** | Manual code improvements | Automatic learning and adaptation |
| **Tools** | IDEs, terminals, build systems | Any simple text editor |
| **AI Integration** | External APIs and complex prompts | Built-in intelligent understanding |

## Quick Example

```neuro
// Instead of writing 200 lines of Python:
pipeline PredictiveMaintenance {
    goal: "Predict machine failure from sensor data"
    constraints: { accuracy: >95%, latency: <100ms }
    data: load('sensors.csv') -> auto_clean() -> feature_discovery()
    model: automl_search() -> optimize_for(constraints)
    deploy: as_microservice(on='edge')
}
