# Setting Up Weekly Job Search

Your system can automatically run job searches every week!

## Quick Setup

### Option 1: Run Once Per Week (Recommended)

Create a Windows Task Scheduler task to run it weekly:

```bash
# Test it first - run immediately
python schedule_job_search.py --run-now

# If that works, you can set up Windows Task Scheduler
```

### Option 2: Keep Script Running (Continuous)

The scheduler will run continuously and execute weekly:

```bash
# Run every Monday at 9 AM (default)
python schedule_job_search.py

# Custom schedule: Every Friday at 6 PM
python schedule_job_search.py --day friday --time 18:00

# Press Ctrl+C to stop when you're done
```

**Note**: This requires the terminal to stay open.

## Windows Task Scheduler Setup (Best for Weekly Automation)

1. **Open Task Scheduler** (search in Windows Start menu)

2. **Create Basic Task**:
   - Name: "Neuro Weekly Job Search"
   - Description: "Automatically searches for jobs weekly"
   - Trigger: Weekly
   - Day: Monday (or your choice)
   - Time: 9:00 AM (or your choice)

3. **Action**: Start a program
   - Program/script: `python`
   - Arguments: `schedule_job_search.py --run-now`
   - Start in: `C:\Users\elena\Downloads\Neuro-main\Neuro-main`

4. **Conditions**:
   - âœ… Start the task only if the computer is on AC power
   - âœ… Wake the computer to run this task (if you want)

5. **Settings**:
   - âœ… Allow task to be run on demand
   - âœ… Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed

## What Happens Weekly

Every week, the system will:

1. âœ… Search all platforms (Wellfound, RemoteOK, Indeed, LinkedIn, startup boards)
2. âœ… Score jobs against your profile
3. âœ… Generate detailed reports
4. âœ… Save results to JSON
5. âœ… Prepare tailored resumes for top matches (if enabled)
6. âœ… Email you results (if configured)

## Test It First

Before setting up weekly automation, test it:

```bash
python schedule_job_search.py --run-now
```

This runs the job search immediately to make sure everything works.

## Files Generated Weekly

- `job_search_results/job_search_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Full results
- `job_search_reports/weekly_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` - Human-readable report
- `resume_templates/` - Tailored resumes (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: schedule"
```bash
pip install schedule
```

### Script doesn't run
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Check that `profile_config.json` exists
- Verify Python path in Task Scheduler

### Want to change schedule
Just edit the Windows Task Scheduler task, or run with different options:
```bash
python schedule_job_search.py --day tuesday --time 14:00
```

**You're all set!** Your job search will now run automatically every week. ðŸš€
