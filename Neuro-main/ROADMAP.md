# Neuro Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Next 3 months)
- [ ] Define core language syntax
- [ ] Build basic parser/lexer
- [ ] Create "Hello World" compiler that targets Python
- [ ] Implement basic tensor operations
- [ ] Document language specification

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Compiler (6 months)
- [ ] Implement auto-differentiation
- [ ] Basic neural network definitions
- [ ] Simple optimizations
- [ ] Community examples and tutorials

## Phase 3: Production Ready (12+ months)
- [ ] LLVM backend for native code
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Package ecosystem
- [ ] IDE integrations

## Get Involved
We need help with:
- Language design discussions
- Parser implementation
- Documentation
- Testing
- Community building
