# Setting Up Weekly Job Search in GitHub Actions

Your weekly job search can now run automatically on GitHub every Monday!

## What Was Created

‚úÖ **`.github/workflows/weekly_job_search.yml`**
- Runs every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- Can also be triggered manually
- Saves results as artifacts
- Generates summary reports

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Secrets (Optional)

For email in profile config, add to GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Secrets and variables` ‚Üí `Actions`
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add secret:
   - Name: `USER_EMAIL`
   - Value: `elena.mereanu@gmail.com`

### 2. Update Profile Config

The workflow uses a template profile config. You can:

**Option A**: Use secrets for email (recommended)
- Email comes from `USER_EMAIL` secret
- Keeps email private

**Option B**: Hardcode in workflow file
- Less secure but simpler
- Update the `profile_config.json` creation step

### 3. Add Resume Path (Optional)

If you want resume tailoring, you need to:

1. Upload your resume to a private location
2. Or add it as a secret (base64 encoded)
3. Or skip resume tailoring in Actions (jobs will still be found)

## How It Works

### Schedule
- **When**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- **What**: Runs `python run_neuro.py my_job_search.neuro`
- **Results**: Saved as GitHub Actions artifacts

### Manual Trigger
You can also trigger it manually:
1. Go to `Actions` tab
2. Select "Weekly Job Search"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click green button

### Artifacts
Results are saved as downloadable artifacts:
- `job_search_results/` - JSON results
- `job_search_reports/` - Text reports
- `resume_templates/` - Tailored resumes (if enabled)

### Retention
- Artifacts kept for 30 days
- Download before they expire

## Customization

### Change Schedule

Edit `.github/workflows/weekly_job_search.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Monday 9 AM UTC
```

Cron format: `minute hour day month day-of-week`

Examples:
- `0 9 * * 1` - Monday 9 AM
- `0 14 * * 5` - Friday 2 PM
- `0 9 * * *` - Every day 9 AM

### Add Email Notifications

Add step to workflow:

```yaml
- name: Send email notification
  uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
  with:
    server_address: smtp.gmail.com
    server_port: 465
    username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USER }}
    password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
    subject: Weekly Job Search Results
    to: ${{ secrets.USER_EMAIL }}
    body: |
      Weekly job search completed!
      Download results from GitHub Actions.
```

### Add Resume Tailoring

If you want tailored resumes in Actions:

1. Upload resume to private repo or secret
2. Decode in workflow step
3. Save to workspace
4. Resume preparer will use it

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow doesn't run
- Check Actions tab for errors
- Verify cron syntax
- Check if repository secrets are set

### No results generated
- Check profile_config.json was created
- Verify my_job_search.neuro exists
- Check Actions logs for errors

### Results not visible
- Check artifacts tab in Actions
- Verify files were created
- Check retention period (30 days)

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- Don't commit `profile_config.json` with personal info
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Resume files should be private
- Consider using private repository

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit the workflow file
2. ‚úÖ Push to GitHub
3. ‚úÖ Wait for Monday (or trigger manually)
4. ‚úÖ Check Actions tab for results
5. ‚úÖ Download artifacts
