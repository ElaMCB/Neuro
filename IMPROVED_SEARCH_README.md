## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works:

1. **RemoteOK API**: Fetches 100+ remote jobs via their public JSON API
2. **Local Filtering**: Searches job titles and descriptions for:
   - Target roles: "prompt engineer", "ai engineer", "ml engineer"
   - Skills: "python", "pytorch", "llm", "gpt", "transformers", "ai", "ml"
3. **Smart Matching**: Gives 70% match scores to relevant positions
4. **Fallback Links**: Adds curated search URLs for other platforms

### Why RemoteOK?

- ✅ Public JSON API (no authentication needed)
- ✅ 100+ remote jobs updated daily
- ✅ Tech-focused positions
- ✅ No anti-scraping measures
- ✅ Fast and reliable

### Other Platforms:

- **Wellfound/LinkedIn/Indeed**: Have anti-scraping protections
- **Solution**: Provide optimized search URLs
- **Benefit**: Still saves time by opening pre-filtered searches

  - Match score badges (70%+, 40-70%, <40%)
  - Platform tags (color-coded)
  - Company names
  - Locations
  - Descriptions
  - "View Job" buttons

## 🔄 Running Manually

### Just Search:
```bash
python improved_job_search.py
```

### Search + View Report:
```bash
python improved_job_search.py && python convert_my_results.py improved_results.json
```

### Test if API is working:
```bash
python -c "import requests; print('API Status:', requests.get('https://remoteok.com/api').status_code)"
```

Should return: `API Status: 200`
