> "What if you could describe what you want, not how to build it?"

Neuro is a new programming language where you declare what you want to achieve with AI, and the compiler figures out how to make it happen. Stop writing boilerplate code and start declaring your intent.

# Vision
Simple: No AI/ML expertise required

Fast: Minutes instead of weeks

Accessible: Works with just a text editor

Powerful: Builds production-ready systems

Stop writing code. Start declaring intent.

# How It Works

// Describe your goal

pipeline JobApplicationTracker {
    goal: "Track job applications and optimize outreach"
    data: [linkedin_profiles, job_descriptions, application_status]
    analyze: [response_rates, skill_gaps, company_fit]
    output: daily_summary_email
}

# Get Started
Create a .neuro file

Describe your AI task in plain English + simple structure

## Quick Example

```neuro
// Instead of writing 200 lines of Python:
pipeline PredictiveMaintenance {
    goal: "Predict machine failure from sensor data"
    constraints: { accuracy: >95%, latency: <100ms }
    data: load('sensors.csv') -> auto_clean() -> feature_discovery()
    model: automl_search() -> optimize_for(constraints)
    deploy: as_microservice(on='edge')
}
