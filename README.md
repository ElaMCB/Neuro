# Neuro
A language for AI: Making AI development accessible through intent-driven programming
# Neuro: The Intent-Driven Language for AI

> "What if you could describe what you want, not how to build it?"

Neuro is a new programming language where you declare **what** you want to achieve with AI, and the compiler figures out **how** to make it happen.

## The Vision

```neuro
// Instead of writing 200 lines of Python:
pipeline PredictiveMaintenance {
    goal: "Predict machine failure from sensor data"
    constraints: { accuracy: >95%, latency: <100ms }
    data: load('sensors.csv') -> auto_clean() -> feature_discovery()
    model: automl_search() -> optimize_for(constraints)
    deploy: as_microservice(on='edge')
}

Why Neuro?
No more glue code: Stop wrestling with 15 different ML libraries

From research to production: Same code runs everywhere

AI-native syntax: Built for tensors, gradients, and data flows

Compiles to optimized native code: No Python overhead

Get Involved
This is Day 1. We're building this in the open and need:

Language designers

Compiler engineers

ML practitioners

Dreamers and visionaries

Quick Start
bash
# Clone and explore
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-lang.git
cd neuro-lang
Note: Neuro is pre-alpha. The real magic starts now.

## Step 3: Create Essential Project Files

Create these files in your repository:

### `ROADMAP.md`
```markdown
# Neuro Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Next 3 months)
- [ ] Define core language syntax
- [ ] Build basic parser/lexer
- [ ] Create "Hello World" compiler that targets Python
- [ ] Implement basic tensor operations
- [ ] Document language specification

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Compiler (6 months)  
- [ ] Implement auto-differentiation
- [ ] Basic neural network definitions
- [ ] Simple optimizations
- [ ] Community examples and tutorials

## Phase 3: Production Ready (12+ months)
- [ ] LLVM backend for native code
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Package ecosystem
- [ ] IDE integrations

## Get Involved
We need help with:
- Language design discussions
- Parser implementation
- Documentation
- Testing
- Community building
CONTRIBUTING.md
markdown
# How to Contribute to Neuro

## Ways to Help
1. **Join design discussions** - Help shape the language syntax
2. **Try the examples** - Does the language make sense?
3. **Report issues** - Found a problem? Tell us!
4. **Write documentation** - Help others understand
5. **Submit code** - See "good first issues"

## Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-lang.git
cd neuro-lang
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 4: Set Up Project Structure

Create this initial directory structure:
neuro-lang/
├── README.md
├── ROADMAP.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE
├── examples/
│ └── hello_world.neuro
├── docs/
│ └── language_spec.md
├── src/
│ └── neuro/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── parser.py
│ └── compiler.py
└── tests/
└── test_parser.py

## Step 5: Create Your First "Example"

In `examples/hello_world.neuro`:
// The first Neuro program!
pipeline HelloNeuro {
goal: "Learn the language by example"

text
data: synthetic() -> visualize()

model: linear_regression(
    features: ["x1", "x2"],
    target: "y"
)

output: "This is what Neuro will look like!"
}

text

## Step 6: Initialize Your Development Environment

Create `requirements.txt`:
Core development
pytest>=7.0.0
black>=23.0.0
mypy>=1.0.0

Parser tools (we'll start with these)
lark-parser>=1.1.0

text

## Step 7: Make Your First Commit

```bash
# Local setup
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-lang.git
cd neuro-lang

# Add all files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Neuro language foundation"
git push origin main
